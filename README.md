This is a test project for Avanza Innovations. It covers the following:

Objective: Demonstrate your proficiency in Unity's Addressable Assets system, and showcase your skills in runtime script compilation by implementing a project that efficiently manages and loads assets, with the added feature of compiling and executing scripts at runtime.

** Requirements:**

**Setup:**
Create a new Unity project (preferably using the latest stable version).
Set up the Addressable Assets system in the project.
**Scene and UI:**
Design a simple scene with at least two game objects.
Implement a basic user interface with buttons to load different assets.
**Addressable Asset Groups:**
Create at least two Addressable Asset Groups to manage different types of assets (e.g., textures, prefabs, audio).
Add assets to each group.
**Asset Loading:**
Implement a script that loads assets from the Addressable Asset Groups when a button is pressed.
Use asynchronous loading to ensure smooth gameplay.
**Asset Reference and Dependency:**
Demonstrate the use of AssetReference to load assets by reference.
Set up dependencies between assets and ensure they are loaded correctly.
**Remote Hosting:**
Configure a remote server (e.g., Google Cloud, Amazon S3) to host a few assets remotely.
Modify the Addressable Asset Groups to load assets remotely.
**Runtime Script Compilation:**
Implement a feature that allows the compilation and execution of C# scripts at runtime.
Provide a button in the UI that, when clicked, dynamically compiles and executes a script that interacts with loaded assets.
**Error Handling:**
Implement error handling for asset loading failures and script compilation errors.
Provide meaningful feedback to the user in case of errors.
**Build and Test:**
Build the project for different platforms (e.g., PC, Android).
Test the application to ensure assets load correctly on different platforms.
Verify that the runtime script compilation works as intended.
